JAPersistentFileReference

Store file references in a property list format. For file URLs, uses bookmark
data (when available) and aliases to track files even if they're moved or
renamed.

This is only really useful for supporting systems older than Mac OS X 10.6.
For new development, don't do that. It's silly.
